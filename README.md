# BudgetPlanner - A personal financial planning tool

**Final project for Harvard Extension CSCI E-56 Web App Dev with Groovy and Grails**

# Summary
BudgetPlanner (TBD) is a personal financial planning tool. Users can create budgets at the daily level. These budgets support multiple accounts, as well as repeatable and one-time income/expense transactions. Users can compare budgets to determine how differences affect their overall financial picture. The core value of the tool is its support of planning and decision making, i.e. a future-focused tool instead of a present-focused tool. This tool can be used in a variety of ways.
# Use Cases
- **Sarah** is a young professional in an expensive city who is constantly on the go. Between student loans and rent, her budget is tight, and she needs to be able to make a budget that will support her needs. Sarah only has a phone and a tablet, but would still like a full-featured and visually-rich experience.
- **Christine** is a retiree on fixed income. She has never been good with money but needs to make a budget to stretch the money that comes in each month. She is considering moving to a new apartment, getting a part time job, and/or cutting a few expenses. She’d like to compare a few different combinations before deciding which budget to implement.
- **Michael** is a freelance theatrical lighting designer. His jobs are sporadic and the pay varies widely. He needs to be able to see how each gig will affect his ability to pay for the things he needs. Specifically, he needs to make sure he saves enough money during the busy season to pay his expenses during the slow season.
- **Jenna** needs to choose a college. She’d like to compare projected salaries for a couple careers she is interested in with the cost of the 5 schools she is considering attending. Her parents are unwilling to send her to a private school if she will not be able to pay back her loans.
# Inspiration
This project is an extension of a series of excel workbooks I created to make personal finance decisions in my own life. I was frustrated with the existing websites and apps that were out there because they didn’t have daily budgets or the ability to make a few budgets and compare them. A personal finance tool like Mint.com is exceptional at capturing my current financial picture, and the new Bills feature is good at detecting definite events, but overall Mint.com doesn’t allow for easy decision-making and planning.
